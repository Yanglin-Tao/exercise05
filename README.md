A CS-3113 Game Programming project.

Working in a new group of 3 create a 3D topdown adventure game. The game will incorporate a point and click interface with pathfinding and navmesh agents. This game will be about exploring rooms, and collecting items. This world includes keys and locked doors as well as obstacles and traps. Progress must be gated in some manner that requires changing the game state. Consider how best to use scenes and variables to store states. You are encouraged to keep the aesthetic quite simple but there does need to be player feedback for whatever form of environmental interaction your game includes. Donâ€™t forget, music, sound effects, ui, and a complete game loop.
